# 05-work-day-scheduler

## Description

This project is an attempt to create a work day scheduler to manage a list of tasks to do for a given day. This scheduler is separated by time blocks from 9am to 5pm. Users can input given tasks for their day within the description of these time blocks and have the option to save them. Upon saving, the text within the specified block is saved in local storage and can be accessed and viewed even after refreshing the application. This project also uses the moment.js library to color code the past, present, and future hours of a given day. Aditional styling and media querries were also used to provide a better user experience.
